# RC Car
This is the design document for the rc car
## Drive system
One brushless motor on one axle with oneway bearing.  
- Big red engine with VESC?


One RC motor, probs a 4stroke gasoline engine with a oneway bearing.  
- [NR200](https://www.folkstyler.com/product/nr200-8-6cc-inline-2-cylinder-4-stroke-water-cooled-engine-with-original-starter-kit/)  

[Disc brakes](https://nl.aliexpress.com/i/32971055429.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2nld)  
Both systems are geared pre gearbox for optimal performance

That into a gearbox that contains reverse, forwards, neutral and some sequential controlled gearing.  
The system also goes in a 3 way selector for front 2 wheel, back 2 wheel and 4wheel power. AKA, all wheels can be powered.  
The front wheels have the steering(DUH) There is braking on the output that goes onto the 3way selector.  
All the wheels will have braking on them as well.  
## Electronics
My RC_TXRX system is a nice to have. If not then a dumbo-rc with gyro.  
Full lighting.  
Start-stop system for the engine.  
- Starter not needed  
- Stop system?

3s or 4s lipo for everything.  
GPS.  
Propper ESC.
- VESC?

Charge option without removing the battery.  
High powered servo's.  
Power distribution board
- I still have that one

## CAD Designs
Try and use the old nitro car for parts/Platform to build on  

Gearbox 8 speed
- Going to redesign the lego gearbox

FWD/RWD/4WD selector  
- Default is 4WD
- One servo to switch to fwd/rwd

Reverse/Neutral/Forward selector
- Same system as the other selector
