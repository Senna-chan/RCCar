This repository holds the CAD files, MCU code, digital twin and digitally + fysical design documents for the RC car I am dreaming of building one day.
The CAD files are made in FreeCAD
The code will be STM32HAL for a STM32F407VET6 board(That is now just a devboard)
The digital twin is made in Unity, simply because I still have some knowledge of it

The RC car will be a hybrid car with both a electric engine and a gasoline/nitro engine
It will have a pretty cool drivetrain with a gearbox, forwards/reverse shifter and the coolest part, a FWD/RWD/AWD system to be able to drift and have better traction controll
The diffs will be able to lock remotely and if possible the front and rear will have seperate brakes
